_projects:_ "Rudolph" - a fun webpage for a friend 

_topics:_ Pure CSS modals

_progress:_ Built modal windows using pure CSS. The goal of this entire project has been to build a basic application with a beautiful user interface without using any frameworks. I abandoned this goal early on in order to build more aesthetically appealing checkboxes. Otherwise, the project has been built in pure CSS. My intention is to build the site using vanilla Javascript.
