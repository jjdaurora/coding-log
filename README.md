A public log of my progress as a developer in 2018.


## 26 - 28 Dec 2017
_projects:_ "Rudolph" - a fun webpage for a friend 

_topics:_ Project overhaul // CSS Grid

_progress:_ After reviewing my code, I realized that I needed to make a lot of changes in order to achieve the project's goal. This decision, inevitably, led me down a rabbit hole that I never quite climed out of. I did learn some great CSS Grid basics. My takeaway from this project is that some projects are supposed to suck. In this case, I needed to waste a lot of time messing around with div arrangements and columns/rows layout in order to get a feel for CSS grid. My next step is to take a class on CSS Grid and truly get the hang of it.

I also implemented some nice jQuery easing features into the project's scroll functionality. Yes, I know I abandoned pure JS for this project. But, due to the amount of work put into CSS Grid, I gave myself a break. 

_time spent:_ ~10 hours

## 22 Dec 2017
_projects:_ "Rudolph" - a fun webpage for a friend 

_topics:_ Pure CSS modals

_progress:_ Built modal windows using pure CSS. The goal of this entire project has been to build a basic application with a beautiful user interface without using any frameworks. I abandoned this goal early on in order to build more aesthetically appealing checkboxes. Otherwise, the project has been built in pure CSS. My intention is to build the site using vanilla Javascript.
